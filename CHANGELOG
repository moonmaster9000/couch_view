v0.1.1
  -- bug fix: conditions were no longer working when set additively

v0.1.0
  -- the name of the conditions on a map/reduce can now be overriden; they default to the unqualified module name. See the README.

v0.0.3
  -- conditions are now additive if a map is defined multiple times

v0.0.2
  -- add support for "key" query option (duh!)
